# Disruptive Technology

## Innovator's Dilemma

Distinguises two types of innovation:

- **Sustaining Innovations**
    - incremental improvents on existing products, attractive to existing customers, existing business model
    - eventually, you offer more than the customer wants
- **Disruptive Innovations**
    - perform less well than existing products
    - may be lower quality and less sophisticated, but simpler, cheaper, more user-friendly

Disruptive innovations cause incumbents to falt:

- incumbents use short-term strategy: serve higher-margin higher-volume market-leading established technology to established customers
- leaves low end of market to others
- they do this to preserve brand

**Dilemma**: incumbents makes sensible decisions over time (that made them successful), but eventually get disrupted: leads to failure of company. *Sometimes successful incumbents must invest in doing the wrong thing*.

## Seeing What's Next

*Innovator's Dilemma* concentrates on identifying and demonstrating existence of disruptions and the dilemma. *Seeing What's Next* addresses what to do about it.

- Empirical, theroy-based predictive approach
- Argues for a performance-based perspective, even on product industries
    - successful companies offer better possibilities for getting things done
    - disruptive innovations easier to spot in advance under this view
- Three styles of innovations
    1. Sustaining: for existing products & high-margin markets where there is real demand for improvements
    2. Low-cost alternatives: for low-end market who happily pay less for the same functionality
    3. New products: create new markets, recruit new customers who are not currently interacting with the company

Sometimes, best to give disruptive technology to a spin-out: separate from existing culture/brand.

# Pipeline vs Platform Business

**Pipeline: 1990s to early 2000s:** eBay, Google, Amazon, Baidu.
**Platform: 2000s to now:** Facebook, Spotify, Dropbox, AirBnb, Uber, Snapchat, Deliveroo...


Early web disrupters were *pipeline* businesses:

- physical stuff replaced by digital media: faster, cheaper

Many modern disrupters are *platform* businesses:

- create an online *venue* for matching demand (customers) to supply (people providing work, or access to assets)
- technically, is a *two-sided matching problem*

# The "gig economy"

Professions where you only get payed for doing the *gig*, not a salaried employee of a company:

- taxi driver only paid for completing each trip
- photographer paid for each shoot
- freelance/self-employed lawyers, carpenters, builders, etc paid for each job

Platform businesses act as *re-intermediators* and *aggregators*:

- lower barriers to entry for suppliers
- aggregation of supply makes them attractive to customers: ease of finding supplier soon
- large #customers makes joining platform attractive to suppliers

Concerns:

- your boss is an algorithm
- self-employed: no health, welfare and other regulations

This is a new worker marketplace, but welfare regulation doesn't really exist for it.

## The future of work

- Internet lowers cost of discovery: digital goods have low transport costs.
- Multi-sided matching platforms enable buyer/seller discovery

Human vs machine buyers:

- Uber, AirBnB: buyer and seller are humans with resources
- What is resources sold is *intelligence* and seller is a machine
    - Convergence of internet, cloud, AI/ML automation: **it is likely many skilled-human jobs will be eliminated**
    - E.g. Self driving vehicles (taxi, lorries)
    - E.g. Intelligent services: translators
