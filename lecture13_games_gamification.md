### Virtual Game Economics

- In-game virtual economies have many of the same issues as real economies (though no taxation)
- For a persistent world to maintain a stable economy, a balance must be struck between currency **sources** and **sinks**
- If imbalances exist, this leades to **MUDflation**
- High-end players create their own metagame currencies, e.g. Dragon Kill Points (DKP)
- Virtual grime is often a problem in PvP games
- Membrane between real and virtual worlds is permeable.

#### "Real" game economics

- Some players cheat
- Catstronova's 2001 analysis of Everquest (EQ)
    - Exchange rate between EQ Gold and US$
    - EQ's GDP per capita higher than many real-world countries (e.g. Bulgaria)
    - -> In such countries, it makes sense to 'work' in the virtual world


#### Gold Farming

- This lead to gold farming.
- At peak, over 500,000 people worked in gold farming world-wide, mostly in india/china/SE asia/russia/mexico

- There are sites that track exchange rates
- Gold farming is against the game's EULA
- Like any industry, gold farming is becoming increasingly automated

##### Tangent: Online AI & Turing Test

- WoW allows for macros, scripting and programmable UI, but are issues
    - Whats difference between 'helper' and full-on AI?
    - Bots are illegal and hated by players, but are common, despite the 'warden'
    - Who's human, who's AI? -> present-day large-scale Turing Test
    - Use of AI bots ont limited to WoW

#### Gold Farming Economics

- Gold farmers job:
    - sell in-game currency
    - sell in-game items (reqponse from devs: BoE, BoP)
    - power-levelling

- Gold farming shows classic capitalist development
    - Subsistence -> Barter -> Monetisation
    - Wage labour -> globalisation/offshoring -> automation

##### Future of gold farming

- Games companies fight back
    - Strategy was to ignore, but now many fighting it
    - others permit, host or 'become' it
    - Tools to thwart gold farming:
        - reporting, banning, disruption, nerfing, patches, abuse, attacks, devaluation

- Gold farming supplies by doing:
    - revenue adjustment
    - disintermediation
    - diversification
    - increased productivity
    - increased automation

##### Julian Dibbel, Play money

- Memoir on Dibbell's experiences making millions by selling virtual goods
- Introduces **Ludo-capitalism**:
    - people doing something they think of as a play activity, but creating monetizable value for someone else

##### Gold farming figures (2014)

50 million: Number of global MMO game players
(20 million subscription players)
100,000 to 1 million: Estimated number of gold farmers
$150 – Average monthly salary of a gold farmer in China
$4.00 – Usual piecework rate for every 1,000 WoW gold gathered
60,000 to 100,000 – Number of gold-farming firms worldwide
$200m to $3bn – Estimated total real-money trading worldwide (goldfarming and other unauthorized online game goods and services)
$400: Cost of power-levelling (getting to level 75 in Final Fantasy XI)
$13.50: Exchange rate for 5 million gold pieces for the game RuneScape
$1.3m: Highest reported amount made by a gold farmer over a 2-year period
4m to12m: Estimated number of consumers of gold-farming services

##### The Corrupted Blood Plague

- Sep 13 2005: acciental plague hits WoW
- New dungeon and its end boss, who when attacked casted a hit point draining and highly contagious spell 'corrupted blood'
- The spell, intended to last only seconds and function within the new area, soon spread across entire virtual world
- Ensuing pandemic: killed lower-level characters and carried by higher-level ones, drastically changing normal game play, as players did what they could to avoid infection
- Stuided by epidemiologists for its implications of how human populations could react to a real-world epidemic
- Anti-terrorism officials took notice of the event: how some players planned and perpetuated the epidemic

## Game Budgets

- By Steve Theodore - senior on half-life, halo, etc
- Explaining why game budgets have sky-rocketed

- Video game budgets increases driven by 2 trends in part 10-15 yeras
- Real budgets are confidential, but AAA games now hundres of millions dollars
- Avg game budgets have fallen. These are small titles by 10-15 people
    - Usually tiny budget
    - A tiny percentage will become noteworthy/profitable, rest fail
- Big shift: **loss of mid-sized studios with 50-75 people, i.e.e 25m dollar budget projects**
    - Either absorbed by gorilla company or fragmented into mobile/casual/f2p
    - Shift has two causes: growth of **content cost** and of **marketing costs**

- Content costs = total labour costs + content creators
    - Much higher per workpackage
    - E.g. number of person-days to create/animate a character gone from 10 to 100.
    - Creative jobs are highly fragmented by expertise
        - Game devs tired of being small cogs in big studios left to make indie games
        - But for big studios, rising content costs are **useful**:
            -> **rising content costs act as _barrier to entry_**
            
- Resulting problem:
    - **it is hard to justify taking creative risks if you're borrowing 250m dollars for project**
    - **this leads to _sequelitis_, lack of innovation and me-too-ism in AAA space***

- Argues hollywoord has done the same thing
    - today, relatively very cheap and easy to make decent video content
    - -> this becomes a low-margin business
- Games similar
    - Anyone can download Unreal/Unity and get extremely high amount of functionality out-of-the-box
    - Dozens of schools for artists, animators
    - -> supply of developers very high

- This results in only two successful approaches
    - **ultra-lean**: be ultra lean and efficient
    - **ultra-large**: simply out-spend most possible rivals
    - -> is mid-sized, then impossible

## Gamification

- Mechanisms common in gameplay (visible goals, comparative stats, collection, percentage completion, improvement, achievement, reward) are all powerful drivers of human behaviour
    - **they are addictive by design**
- This been recently adopted by non-game industries
    -> this process is called **gamification**
- Location-based - foursquare, ..
- charities - HumanityCalls
- Fitness - WiFit, Nike+, FitBit
- Training - Ribbon Hero
- Education - KhanAcademy, DuoLingo
