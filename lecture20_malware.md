# Malware & Cybercrime

## Motivation

- Criminals target/fake fintech: does that make their work fintech too?
- Cybercrime/cybersecurity are forms of economic activity
- The internet facilitates many new forms of criminal activity, much of it financial
- This has major economic aspects:
    - Cybersecurity is a very big business
    - Cybersecurity failures can be very costly to clean up
    - Criminals can make a lot of money from malware-enabled scams and attacks
- Nation-states now major players too: cybercrime enabling cyberwarfare
    - No Geneva Convention on cyberwar: so anything goes. Cyberwarcrime is underfined.

## Economics of Cybercrime

- Standard PC/server new security market is significant
- 2012: Symantec ranked 6th biggest software company in the world by revenue
    - Software revenues in 2012: 6.4gn
    - 2018 4.5bn
- These companies make legitimate profits/gains from combating computer crime
- If X attacks Y with DoS, Y loses revenue (= cost to Y)
- If X attacks Y with virus/worm, Y pays for cleanup (=cost to Y)
- If X phishes passwords from Y, X can steal money/data from Y (Y loss; X gain)
- If X zombies Y's PC into a botnet, Y's PC works for X (Y cost, X gain)
    - X can charge users of the service now provided by Y (e.g. spam, phishing, porn)

## CSO Online: OCT 2018 Summary

**Ransomware is down, cryptomining is up**

- NotPetya and Wannacryp, ransomware were most talked about in 2017
- But, malware infection rate dropped down to only 10% Dec 2017
- Rather than demanding users send you bitcoins, just infect their computers with bitcoin-mining software without their noticing.
- Early 2018: 90% of all remote code execution attacks associated with cryptomining

**Email is the problem**

- 92% of malware still delivered by email
- Most common: phising attacks
- CyberArk Global Advanced Threat Landscape Report 2018 Survery: 56% say phising attacks top security threat they faced

## History of malware

### Pre 1990

- 1970s: a few isolated, harmless, non-malicious “hack” viruses
- 1982: Apple II operating system floppies infected by Elk Cloner
    - First large-scale infection by replicating code
- 1983/84: “Computer Virus” phrase coined by Fred Cohen
- 1986: Brain Boot Sector virus is first to infect IBM PCs
- 1987: IBM release first antivirus software product to customers
- 1987: Christmas Tree is first to spread via email address book, paralyses several major networks e.g. EARN, BITNET, VNET
- 1989: Morris Worm: first widespread internet release (via Unix, buffer overrun)
- 1989: Ghostball is first multipartite virus (>1 vector: boot sector and .exe)
- 1990: 1260 introduces polymorphic malware to evade pattern-detector antivirals

### Post 1990s

- 1995: Concept Virus first to attack via MSWord macros
- 1998: CIH family of “spacefillers”
    -  – code sliced into “cavities” so that infected files don’t alter in size
- 1999: Melissa mass-mailing macro virus causes widespread shutdown of email
- 2000: ILoveYou worm infected approx 10% of all machines on the internet. Spread
via email address books: opening the email auto-executed a visual basic script to
send the message on to all the host’s contacts (plus trashing important files on
the host). Many mail servers collapsed under the sudden spike in activity.
Estimated $5.5bn clean-up costs. Pentagon, CIA, and UK Parliament all had to
shutdown email systems, as did many large corporations (cf Christmas Tree?)
- 2001: CodeRed buffer overrun in Msft InternetInfoService: copied itself to multiple
hosts, then sat dormant for DoS attack on a number of fixed IP addresses,
including www.whitehouse.gov. 359,000 hosts with peak infection rate of
2,000/min. IIS patch had been available for months
- CodeRedII followed a few months later

## Virus Throttling

- By HP, prevents rapid spread of 'epidemics' before malware signature is identified

## Cyberwar

- Miliary hardware commissioning costs are hugely expensive relative to attack-by-sftware
- Anti-detection countermeasures for military hardware (e.g. no detection by radar) are difficult/expensive; but stealthy software a lot cheaper

## Vulnerability Disclosure

- Security companies and consultants would spot vulnerabilities and disclose them publically ('Ful Disclosure')
- They ague that this forces software company to improve security and release patches
- It also generated publicity for the companies, and possibly lucrative consultancy contracts
- Did it improve security? Or give hackers information?
    - -> Move to 'Responsible Disclosure': Tell the SW company in advance to give them a head start in developing a patch

## The Vulnerabilities Market

- Software vulnerabilities have costs to find: time, expertise
- Software vulnerabilities have a value
    - back hat hackers can gain direct economic benefit
    - SW companies can make their SW more secure
    - Security agencids can conduct surveillance and cyber-warfare
- So an informal 'marketplace' has developed
    - Companies identify vulnerabilities and sell them to highest bidder
    - Small specialist companies and large defense contractors

#### Security for the 1%

- Ethical sellers sell only to 'NATO-approved governments'
- These pay more than the original SW company
- The SW therefore remains vulnerable: security researchers that would formerly have disclosed information do not
- Hence it leads to less secure SW, with government agencies holding the levers
- Furthermore, even ethical sellers may be fooled into selling to a black hat organisation, due to the use of 'middlemen'

## Economics of InfoSec

- Poineered by Anderson
- Many security systems/measures fail because the economic incentives in the system don't match the security needs/requirements
    - failures because of bad incentives rather than bad design
    - E.g. person who guards system is not person who suffers when system falls to attacks, then guarding likely to be inneffective

### Open problems in Security-Economics

1. Algorithmic Mechanism Design

- Design the network protocols and interfaces to be strategy-proof
- Designing bad behaviour out of systems may be cheaper than policing it afterwards
- Using auction theory, e.g. combinatorial auctions for distributed strategy-proof routing

2. Psychology and Security

- Inappropriate obedience (e.g. phone PIN phising)
- Security usability and studies of deception
- Behavioral Economics
    - humans are not always perfectly rational and/or perfectly self-interested
    - decision-making under risk and uncertainty shows several cognitive biases
    - recent research indicates systematic gender biases too
        - most men are 'systematizers'
        - most women are 'empathizers'

3. Network topology and infosec

- Network topology can affect conflict dynamics
- Different topologies have different robustness properties
    - E.g. scale-free networks good at resisting random attacks; less good at resisting targeted attacks
- Need to better understand functional topology of technology networks

4. Large project management

- Large IT system project failures can cost billions and threaten whole organisations
- Seems that approx 30% of all large projects fail, regardsless of advances in technology
