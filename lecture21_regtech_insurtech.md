# RegTech and InsureTech

- Some people define FinTech and TechFin as tech for banking only
- Others use it more generally, as tech for financial services
- FSI is more than just banking
- Two FSI areas where new tech is having a big effect:
    - Insurance
    - Regulation of FSI
- The words insurtech and regtech are commonly used
    - New tech applied to insurance and financial regulation

## InsurTech

Straightforward minimal mathematics of insurance:

- Some loss event `L` that requires a payout `C` as compensation
- `N` customers all want to insure against `L`
- `P` is expected number of payouts per year
- If all `N` customrs pay a premium `C*P`/`N` tech year, all if well in the long run. As `N` grows large:
    - individual premium payments get smaller
    - estimates of P get more accurate (law of large numbers)
- If total income exceeds payouts, surplus can be invested or returned
- A reserve fund is maintainted to cover >P payouts per year
- Insurers spread risk of large payouts by buyind 'reinsurance'
- Swiss Reid (largest london reinsurance company, based in Gherkin)

Choosing the right P is the difficult bit - actuarial science.

As N grows large, the cost for insurance decreases. So, lots of InsurTech is aimed at retail insurance, i.e. those aimed at everyday consumers.

- Car insurance, home / life insurance, pensions / retirements
- LV trying to move into InsurTech

Wholesale/enterprise insurance: 

- much larger markets
- Lloyd's of London
    - largest revenue is insuring ships
    - trying to move into InsurTech: started Lloyd's Lab, startup incubator

#### "New realities: risks in virtual world", Lloyd's of London report

- Report on risks of VR/AR/MR on insurance
- See lecture

## LV InsurTech ideas

- Computer vision to detect if repairs so much will be 'write-off' i.e. more than cost of car
- Previously, have expert go to inspect the car

- NLP to decide whether claims are fraudalent / who's correct

## Financial Regulation

In UK: FCA and PRA

PRA: prudential reguation of banks, building socs, major investment functs (ie cannot go bust overnight).

FCA: regulates all other FSI companies, 58k companies, 2.2m employees, Â£65bn tax.
FCA also regulates conduct of PRA-regulated companies.

### Financial Regulation hot topics

- KYC: Know you customer
- AML: anti money laundering

- tech for authenticating who a customer is who they say they are when they open an account.
- enforcing AML regulations

## Just tech

Cliff: its all just tech (which is application neutral) being applied to RegTech/InsurTech.

- Visualizing dynamic bitcoin transaction patterns
    - i.e. visualize flow of bitcoin from node to node: can find ransomware's etc
